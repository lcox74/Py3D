# Py3D

A 3D rasterizer made in python using the pygame libraries to display the polygons.
The program supports .obj files as long as the object has been triangulated as it can't read anything more than triangles at the moment.
I'm also looking into how to make the program run faster.

## Controls
W, A, S, D = Movement
Left, Right Arrows = Rotation
