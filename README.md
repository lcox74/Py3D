# Py3D

A 3D rasterizer made in python using the pygame libraries to display the polygons.
The program supports .obj files as long as the object has been triangulated as it can't read anything more than triangles at the moment.
I'm also looking into how to make the program run faster while still using pygame. Due to using pygame, the speed will always be very limited.

## Controls
- W, A, S, D = Movement
- Left, Right Arrows = Rotation
